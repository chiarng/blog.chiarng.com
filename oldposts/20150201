I know, I know. It's been another long while since I've posted anything. I still don't have the newest Japan pictures up. Houston pictures remain safe on a hard drive but nowhere closer to getting posted. I'm a lazy SFC, and I admit it. So here's (yet) another sunset picture to offset my lack of posts. I keep intending to make this workflow easier to work through, but I haven't gotten around to creating that yet. Right now my workflow for getting a post up involves resizing the image, renaming the image, editing the properties for a title, creating a new log entry for the post, editing the index to include the newest post, then actually posting all of these up into a bunch of different folders on S3. Really, quite a cumbersome and roundabout process. Ideally I'd like to write a simple script that asks for a file from the file system, asks for an entry date, asks for a title, and then asks for blog text. Then have it handle everything, including the uploading to specific buckets. I have a clue as to how to get it to work, but I'm just really really lazy lately. Once I stop being lazy and make it easier for myself to post entries, I'll update more. I think. Anyway, this one's named Tides because that's how I've been seeing life lately. Ebb and flows in all facets. Since you never know whether you are in a low or a high, just enjoy life as it goes and plan for the long run.
