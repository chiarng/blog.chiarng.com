It could be an odd jellyfish or starfish floating in a blue tank somewhere.. but it's actually the ceiling of the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco. A popular site for wedding photographs, I personally prefer the period just after sunset, when the sky turns dark blue and the yellow glow of the lamps turn on to illuminate the sides of the pavilion. It rivals the beauty of the late-afternoon "golden hour" that seems to fill the walkways of the surrounding lake with tourists and local residents. Although the Exploratorium is no longer next to the iconic park, other exhibits sometimes pass through. One time I was there, the personal car collection of the family that owned the Academy of Art University was being displayed. Considering how much real estate they own in San Francisco and how the ubiquity of their campus buildings rival 7-11's in Taiwan, it wasn't a huge surprise to see the extent of the car collection. Anyway, this is one of my favorite places to take people when they visit the city, so if you come visit me, ask me to take you here! I just hope you don't mind the geese!
