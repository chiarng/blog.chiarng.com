Once again we meet with November. Around this time last year, I was in Kyoto enjoying the momiji season. Although you can also see autumn foliage in the States, the quality of the leaves feels somewhat different in Japan. The types of trees have smaller-sized leaves, leaving a more delicate feel to the scenery. They also take a lot of care in choosing the types of trees and where in the temples they are positioned to maximize the views, so I'd say the degree of 精緻-ness is manufactured with a certain purpose. The leaves here at Stanford haven't begun to change colors yet, but the weather is starting to get colder, so I expect them to turn in a few weeks. In a few weeks, I also expect to be hitting up Milan, Florence, Prague, and Sapporo, so hopefully I'll have some newer photos to share rather than just pulling up these older ones. =P
