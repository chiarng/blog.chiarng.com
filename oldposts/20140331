This shoot was done quite a few weeks ago, but I only just got around to posting it.
DISCLAIMER: Emily, our local floating expert, helped to adjust the color saturation and brightness after the shoot.
It's only after taking pictures of people did I realize the necessity of post-processing when it comes to non-landscape photography. Specifically, you are focused on capturing the moment with a person, whereas the color and brightness you can adjust later. With landscape, you can do it on-site, and you have all the time in the world (assuming the lighting conditions are right), so it's not quite as imperative to process afterwards.
Still, you'll see disclaimers from me when I'm posting post-processed photos. Otherwise, assume my shots are straight from the lens.
This was actually my favorite shot of the shoot, although the focus is SLIGHTLY off. But the way she's floating, and how the shadow really accentuates that, really brings the feel of this shot together. It's also nice that the color scheme is pretty coordinated in the pastel region.
