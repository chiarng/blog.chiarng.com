DISCLAIMER: Emily, our local floating expert, helped to adjust the color saturation and brightness after the shoot.
I guess one thing about how cloudy this day came out was how it almost seems like Emily was photoshopped into a scene; the lack of shadows makes it hard to tell the depth of the subject in the shot, and the actual height off the ground they are.
