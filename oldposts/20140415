DISCLAIMER: Emily, our local floating expert, helped to adjust the color saturation and brightness after the shoot. 
Ricky came up with the idea for this shot. The angles were difficult to capture since this was at the corner of an intersection, and there was too much empty space from the other directions. If I could improve on this shot, I'd take out the entire right side of the picture as it doesn't really serve to frame this picture well. Emily's smile is very mischievous in this shot though!
