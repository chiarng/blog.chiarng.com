Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park is full of these stairwells of stone. As the first "eastern national park", it's known for the tallest mountain on the US Atlantic coast. It's not a very big park, inhabiting only an island, but it's quite majestic in its own way, with granite and foliage all over. A must go if you're in Maine, because there's not really much else to do up there.
