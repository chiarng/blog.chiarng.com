Well, my blog is almost finished. This took quite a bit of effort, and it's still not 100% what my vision is. But it's certainly much, much better than the old blogspot (which you can access via oldblog.chiarng.com now). I'd say overall it was quite a learning experience, bumping into all sorts of CSS and JS obstacles. I hope that the effort put into revamping my blog gets some feedback with increased comment usage! It's my goal to get more discussion going on the photography: tips for how to shoot better, how you would've taken it differently, etc. That's why I include the EXIF data. If you have any thoughts on how you want this blog to function or look, comment below and I'll consider it!
