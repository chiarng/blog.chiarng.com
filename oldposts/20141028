This one was taken at the California Academy of Sciences. They have a beautiful multi-story high "tropical forest" exhibit where butterflies float everywhere, sometimes landing on railings, sometimes landing on you. One thing I want to try to do with this blog is to show photos I haven't already posted elsewhere. It might sound easy since there's so much I haven't posted onto my old blogspot, but I do post a fair number onto Facebook. I can't promise every picture is going to be "new", but I'll try! As many shots as I take with the camera, there are precious few that I feel are good enough to post. That coupled with my unwillingness to post-process my photographs means that it's hard to pick things to share if I just didn't take anything good enough. So most of the stuff you've already seen on Facebook are already the best shots I took in those sessions.
